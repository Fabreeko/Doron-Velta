# Doron Velta

This is Fabreeko's repository of Rogerio Goncalves' fantastic Doron Velta project (https://github.com/rogerlz/Doron-Velta).  Here you will find our staff and community member's efforts to organize, improve upon, and support the project.

## What's here?

- Getting started guides
- Complete STLs, CAD, and everything you need to print and build our Doron Velta kits.
  - **All STLs have been fixed, renamed, and are properly oriented for printing!**
  - Standard Voron naming conventions, accents, etc are now used.
  - Optional 3rd color in CAD and STLs. If you only want one accent color treat both [a1] and [a2] as the same color.
