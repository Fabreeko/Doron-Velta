# Doron Velta - CAD Files

The following files have been published by the Fabreeko team:

### Doron_Velta-YYYY.MM.DD-Full_Assembly.stpZ

This is an ISO compliant STEP file.  For applications that do not recongize the stpZ extension, you can unzip the file to reveal the large STEP file within.  

### Doron_Velta-YYYY.MM.DD.FCStd

This is the primary source CAD file we use.  It is a FreeCAD format using FreeCAD Core and LinkStage3 formats.  

Caution for Ondsel ES users: Ondsel changes the FCStd format and breaks a number features.  While you can easily use Ondsel to open and view the file, please do not submit an Ondsel-saved version of FCStd for commit.  Thank you!
